# Language portal replacement

## Terminology

[Microsoft Terminology]([./terminology.md](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjM4MzYyNGQtNjU1MS00ZWE2LTlkY2YtNzllYWVmMWRkMDc4IiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9)) can be used to develop localized versions of applications that integrate with Microsoft products. It can also be used to integrate Microsoft terminology into other terminology collections or serve as a base IT glossary for language development in the nearly 100 languages available. Terminology is provided in .tbx format, an industry standard for terminology exchange.

## Localization Style Guides

[Microsoft Style Guides](../reference/microsoft-style-guides.md) are collections of rules that define language and style conventions for specific languages. These rules usually include general localization guidelines, information on language style and usage in technical publications, and information on market - specific data formats.

## Regional Formats

[Regional Formats Search tool](./regional.md) is really cool!
